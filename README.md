# CarPooling Android App

## Overview 
Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person can travel in a car, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves.

This Mobile App connects driver and passenger willing to travel together between cities and share the cost of the journey.

It shows a medium for available passengers to pick up them on the interest of car owner with time and capacity.


## Workflow

* ### Registration Page :
    * We have built mobile number verification in the app by using Firebase authentication.
    * Once authenticated, it stores user information in the database like as user's name and mobile number.

* ### 'Create Ride' Page :
    * A rider can create ride for source and destination.
    * Ride details are stored in firebase database & are accessible for other users as well.
    * A rider can post multiple rides on the app.

* ### 'Search Ride' Page :
    * A passenger can book a ride here.
    * A passenger needs to input the source and destination and in the backend it searches rides for that source and destination in the firebase database.
